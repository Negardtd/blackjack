The game loop:

1. Create deck, shuffle, deal initial hands.
2. Take player bet.
3. Player turns: hit or stand.
4. After player turn, dealer hits or stands based on rules.
5. Compare hands, determine winner.
6. Adjust player chips.
7. Play again or exit.

This allows a single user to play Blackjack against a dealer controlled by the code. Additional features like splitting or insurance could be added. Enjoy!
